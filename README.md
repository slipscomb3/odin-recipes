Pre-Project:
This is my first full project under the Odin Project.
My goal is to create a basic webpage with a main index and
a few links to recipes.

I am hoping to be comfortable setting up the boiler plate by myself and familarize myself further with the link and image tags.

Post-Project:
It feels good to finish something like this, even if I did kind of half-ass it in the end. I learned how to make use of the vs code commit feature. I also got more comfortable with some of the tab/enter shortcuts.

I am proud of myself. I will continue to do better and better things.
